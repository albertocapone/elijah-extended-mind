I had an incredibly vivid dream with almost perfect narrative coherence, it felt completely real. 

I was in my old house in Rome, living alone with my father since my mother had died, much like my current life, except I actually live in Taranto. He went out to buy some prawns, but I fell asleep, so he ended up eating alone. When I woke up and came downstairs, I found the plate ready for me, and I knew I had disappointed him by making him eat alone.

I walked out the front door, it was raining outside. The door accidentally closed behind me, locking me out. I didn't want to call him; it felt like betraying him twice. I walked around the house and saw the bathroom window was open. 

Suddenly, I heard a sinister voice, a malevolent entity that somehow reminded me of IT. I immediately knew something was wrong. I tried to drive it away by invoking Christ (I found it ridiculous, but didn't know what else to do, and thought of my priest friend Simone, who has actually had experiences as an exorcist, I figured if the entity was real, it would react negatively to these things). The entity suffered, threw its head back, showed its sharp teeth, but vanished.

But it wasn't over. A beautiful boy appeared with green hair, clearly another entity (he reminded me of Baby, the shape-shifting being from Dragon Ball GT). I don't remember exactly what happened, but I remember he showed me a pact, like Rumpelstiltskin, and I had accepted his deal.

The scene changed. I woke up in my Rome house, the furnishings were incredible, everything looked rich. I walked through the living room and saw my father, who reminded me we had to attend some kind of American Express (?) meeting the next day. I discovered it was 2007, and I was 17 years old.

I went upstairs to what used to be my mother's room, and she was still alive and beautiful (she actually passed away this year in March), even more beautiful and younger than she actually was during that period, literally looking like a model. She talked to me, teased me about my sexual activities with a boy in some kind of library a few days before.

Then I heard the voice of the entity from earlier. I turned and saw him, he was there, speaking to me. I don't remember what he said, but shortly after we were in my room and I was penetrating him.


A brief moment of darkness.

I was downstairs again with some friends. They were talking about school, I think. I was surprised by the absence of smartphones. I understood that somehow in this timeline, technology had taken a different direction, and apparently Trump (?!) was involved, in this version of reality, some populist fixation of his had influenced global development in another direction.

But a girl pulled out a different device, a kind of small metal cylinder. I remember she pronounced its name—I remember the letter Z but not precisely (the first thing I associated it with was the reality-altering device from the last season of Black Mirror—basically Aladdin's lamp in technological form, and indeed it was used to summon the genie).

The girl held the little cylinder and pronounced the entity's name three times, and it appeared. I intuited that this step was part of its plan to take everything away from me. I tried to snatch the techno-amulet from the girl and used it to command the entity, ordering it to eclipse itself from space-time.

It was able to speak to me before things happened, asking if I wanted my old life back or if I wanted to continue usurping that of this alternate version of myself, who apparently had some incredible idea, maybe an application (it spoke of "stealing your alter-ego's code").

I hadn't spoken yet, but I had already chosen my old life.

Darkness.

I woke up in my bed in Taranto, it was all a dream. The experience was so vivid that I got chills and tears came to my eyes while talking about it. Even hours later, I still have chills and a sense of having encountered something genuinely autonomous and terrifying.
